 * [x] Auth Endpoints (signUp, logIn, logOut, secret, currentUser, refresh)
 * [ ] Auth Endpoints (passwordReset, confirmEmail)
 * [x] Admin Endpoints (getUsers, getUserById, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser)
 * [x] Access Tokens use Bearer Authentication header (valid for 10min)
 * [x] Refresh Tokens use httpOnly SameSite lax secure cookie (valid for 1day, only 1 RT may be valid per user, using a stale RT will destroy users valid RT for security, generate new AT and RT with valid RT)
